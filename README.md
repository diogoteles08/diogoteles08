GOSST was created as a response to the current scenario of [increasing attacks on supply chain projects][supply-chain-attacks]. The team counts with experienced open-source contributors and works alongside the Open Source Security Foundation ([OpenSSF][ossf]) to develop and spread solutions to make open software safer at scale. You can read more about Google initiatives on open source on [this blogpost][open-source-on-google].

More specifically, I'm part of a sub-team responsible for our direct engagement with the Open Source community. We work with [critical open source projects][critical-projects] to help them increase their security, in any way we can. As a team, our goal is to:

* Build individual analyses and approaches for each project.
* Evaluate and suggest solutions or enhancements that would better fit the repository and not burden the maintainers.
* Welcome and conduct discussions about our suggestion or  any security solutions the maintainers prefer, as we can surely provide specific help according to their demands.
* If possible and wanted, implement the changes ourselves via PRs to contribute with the discussed improvements.
* Collect all kinds of feedback, as we work closely with OpenSSF and any complaints would be kindly heard.

### Security Solutions

See below some of the tools developed by GOSST and the OpenSSF:

* [Scorecards][scorecards]: automated checks to evaluate a project's security practices and suggest improvements as needed
* [SLSA (pronounced "salsa")][slsa]: a standard and protocol to ensure an artifact's provenance, guaranteeing it comes from the expected location and process. It prevents tampering and improves the integrity of infrastructure and consumed packages
* [Sigstore][sigstore]: keyless signing and verification of artifacts
* [OSS-FUZZ][oss-fuzz]: automated [fuzzing][fuzzing] at scale, now fuzzing 800+ projects in 6 languages
* [OSV][osv]: a precise human - and machine - readable database of vulnerabilities that maps affected software versions across open source ecosystems
* [OSV-Scanner][osv-scanner]: A frontend for the OSV Database that connects a project‚Äôs list of dependencies with the vulnerabilities that affect them
* [GUAC][guac]: graph database of security metadata ([in development][guac-gh])
