### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working for Google on Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST), which was created as a response to the current scenario of [increasing attacks on supply chain projects][supply-chain-attacks]. The team counts with experienced open-source contributors and works along with the Open Source Security Foundation ([OpenSSF][ossf]) to develop and spread solutions to make open softwares safer at scale.

More specifically, I'm part of a sub-team responsible for our direct contact with the Open Source community. We work around [critical open source projects][critical-projects] to help increase security, in any aspect or concern that might be relevant. As a team, our goal is to:

* Build individual analyses and approaches for each project.
* Evaluate and suggest solutions or enhancements that would better fit the repository and not overcharge the maintainers.
* Welcome and conduct discussions about our suggestion or about any security solutions the maintainers prefer, as we can surely provide specific help according to their demands.
* If possible and wanted, implement the changes ourselves and create PRs to contribute with the discussed improvements.
* Collect any kinds of feedback, as we work closely with OpenSSF and any complains would be kindly heard.


In regard to the GOSST/OpenSSF security solutions that help securing the supply-chain, we can name:

* [Scorecards][scorecards]: automated checks to evaluate and suggest security practices on your own project or your dependencies
* [SLSA (pronounced "salsa")][slsa]: a check-list of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure in your projects, businesses or enterprises
* [Sigstore][sigstore]: a new standard for signing, verifying and protecting software
* [OSS-FUZZ][oss-fuzz]: a tool for fuzzing at scale and find bugs in critical projects, now fuzzing 800+ projects in 6 languages
* [OSV][osv]: a precise, human - and machine - readable database of vulnerabilities that maps affected software versions across open source ecosystems
