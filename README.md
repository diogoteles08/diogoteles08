### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently working for Google on Google Open Source Security Team (GOSST). The team counts with experienced open-source contributors and works with the Open Source Security Foundation ([OpenSSF][ossf]) to develop and spread solutions to make open softwares safer at scale.

More specifically, I'm part of a sub-team responsible for our direct contact with the Open Source community. We work directly with [critical open source projects][critical-projects] to make targeted improvements where they're most needed. Our goal is to have individual analysis and approach on each project. We evaluate solutions and enhancements that would better fit the repository and not overcharge the maintainers. Discussions about the maintainers preferred security solutions are broadly welcome and we can surely help the way they prefer. As we're closely connected to OpenSSF, we are also specially open to feedbacks, being happy to redirect them to the right people and help the team to support even better the supply-chain security.

The main tools developed by GOSST team are:

* Scorecards
* SLSA
* Sigstore
* OSS-FUZZ
